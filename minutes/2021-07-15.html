<h3 id=t01>Reminder to fill out time survey at <a href="https://forms.gle/8Q3y6CBMDHpPdfrw7">https://<wbr>forms.gle/<wbr>8Q3y6CBMDHpPdfrw7</a></h3>
<p id=x038 class="phone s01"><cite>Eric:</cite> We have a survey to find a regular meeting time.<br>
<span id=x039>… We want to meet every other week. Everyone, please fill out the survey.</span></p>
<p id=x040 class="phone s02"><cite>Wilco:</cite> Suggest we take a look at the times</p>
<p id=x041 class="phone s01"><cite>Eric:</cite> I will figure it out and let everyone know.</p>

<h3 id=t02>A11y features list, assign tasks</h3>
<p id=x048 class=irc><cite>&lt;yatil&gt;</cite> <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dLgBtrMinu-GtckijkyHXbB0E_zQK3Xk0bv7gElLCqM/edit#">https://<wbr>docs.google.com/<wbr>document/<wbr>d/<wbr>1dLgBtrMinu-GtckijkyHXbB0E_zQK3Xk0bv7gElLCqM/<wbr>edit#</a></p>
<p id=x052 class="phone s01"><cite>Eric:</cite> Last time we talked about collecting features. Marcus was quick to fill out Firefox. Wilco did a few things for Chrome.<br>
<span id=x053>… I've signed up for Safari but I'm officially lazy.</span><br>
<span id=x054>… I think we need to assign them, so we can get an overview of features already there.</span><br>
<span id=x055>… Any takers for Edge?</span></p>
<p id=x056 class="phone s03"><cite>Bee:</cite> I'll take Brave</p>
<p id=x057 class="phone s01"><cite>Eric:</cite> Anyone for Windows?</p>
<p id=x059 class="phone s01"><cite>Eric:</cite> Marcus signed up for iOS<br>
<span id=x060>… We may also want to look at extensions.</span></p>
<p id=x062 class="phone s01"><cite>Eric:</cite> Killian has signed up for Fix Contrast</p>
<p id=x064 class=irc><cite>&lt;hdv&gt;</cite> Wilco: for Chrome I included some official Chrome extensions, four of them</p>
<p id=x066 class=irc><cite>&lt;hdv&gt;</cite> Wilco: do you want those listed separately or under Chrome?</p>
<p id=x067 class=irc><cite>&lt;hdv&gt;</cite> yatil: fine to put them under Chrome as they are official</p>
<p id=x069 class="phone s04"><cite>Todd:</cite> I'll take up collecting features for Windows</p>
<p id=x073 class="phone s05"><cite>Jules:</cite> Can others add features for Firefox</p>
<p id=x074 class="phone s01"><cite>Eric:</cite> Yes, if you think something's missing, feel free to add it</p>
<p id=x075 class="phone s05"><cite>Jules:</cite> I often use outline in Firefox, is that a feature built into Firefox?</p>
<p id=x076 class="phone s01"><cite>Eric:</cite> Not sure which feature you mean.</p>
<p id=x077 class="phone s05"><cite>Jules:</cite> If you got to settings in Firefox, you get a warning not to change it.</p>
<p id=x078 class="phone s01"><cite>Eric:</cite> If you can hack Firefox in that way, that's something we want to highlight.</p>
<p id=x079 class="phone s06"><cite>Marcus:</cite> A setting behind a flag, it's hidden and hacky, but it is a feature</p>
<p id=x080 class="phone s01"><cite>Eric:</cite> As much as you find, put it in.</p>
<p id=x081 class=irc><cite>&lt;hdv&gt;</cite> Wilco: I started testing these things and noticed a quirk in high contrast mode, limitations of that feature. It turns out what that tool does it makes the dark colours darker and the light colours lighter… which sometimes causes it to decrease the contrast… is that something we'd like to capture in some way?</p>
<p id=x082 class=irc><cite>&lt;hdv&gt;</cite> yatil: yes would be useful to add as comments</p>
<p id=x083 class=irc><cite>&lt;hdv&gt;</cite> Wilco: in the Google Doc?</p>
<p id=x084 class=irc><cite>&lt;hdv&gt;</cite> yatil: yes seems fine</p>

<h3 id=t03>A11y features survey, assign tasks</h3>
<p id=x087 class=irc><cite>&lt;yatil&gt;</cite>  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gekZ5y_D13g3TnhdB-sCafim8yjVGbObtCDbM7cisTU/edit?usp=sharing">https://<wbr>docs.google.com/<wbr>document/<wbr>d/<wbr>1gekZ5y_D13g3TnhdB-sCafim8yjVGbObtCDbM7cisTU/<wbr>edit?usp=sharing</a></p>
<p id=x090 class="phone s01"><cite>Eric:</cite> We haven't done anything on the survey yet. We wanted to formulate questions to bring in front of users, asking what features they need or what features they used.<br>
<span id=x091>… Should we spend some time brainstorming questions?</span></p>
<p id=x093 class="phone s07"><cite>Kilian:</cite> What kind of questions are we looking for?</p>
<p id=x096 class="phone s01"><cite>Eric:</cite> Relatively open questions, things like what features in your browser do you use. Things like that.<br>
<span id=x097>… We might have multiple choice of what feature they use, and maybe some features of what else we use</span></p>
<p id=x099 class="phone s06"><cite>Marcus:</cite> Is the intention that we pose questions like &quot;are you aware that you can zoom&quot;? Or is that too meta.</p>
<p id=x100 class="phone s01"><cite>Eric:</cite> Need to discuss if this is for people who already use accessibility features.</p>
<p id=x101 class="phone s07"><cite>Kilian:</cite> I think we'll primarily reach people already using a11y features.</p>
<p id=x102 class="phone s03"><cite>Bee:</cite> I know people who use accessibility features, but don't know that they are.</p>
<p id=x103 class="phone s01"><cite>Eric:</cite> Maybe we could frame it like &quot;ease of use&quot; features? Do we want to give them a list of features, or a free-form text field.</p>
<p id=x105 class="phone s03"><cite>Bee:</cite> Might be useful to give categories.<br>
<span id=x106>… Things related to browser, thing related to the device.</span></p>
<p id=x108 class="phone s07"><cite>Kilian:</cite> Caution against casting too wide a net. We have limited reach. The people that will answer this survey are people in our wider network.<br>
<span id=x109>… It seems we should focus more on quantitative data as to what features they use. Based on that we can do another survey that is wider cast.</span></p>
<p id=x113 class="phone s01"><cite>Eric:</cite> We could make a list of features we've collected, and then a free form field.<br>
<span id=x114>… As well as let user fill what they need, for something there isn't a feature for yet.</span><br>
<span id=x115>… That keeps it short, but we'd use browser features first.</span><br>
<span id=x116>… I can send out this survey to a list at Knowbility. They have a list of people with various disabilities.</span></p>
<p id=x119 class="phone s01"><cite>Eric:</cite> Kilian is writing in the document.</p>
<p id=x121 class="phone s03"><cite>Bee:</cite> Do we want to only target English speakers?</p>
<p id=x122 class="phone s01"><cite>Eric:</cite> I think so, if not we'd have to get translators.</p>
<p id=x126 class="phone s02"><cite>Wilco:</cite> Could we suggest some features users might want, that don't yet exist, and then ask them if they'd want to use them.</p>
<p id=x130 class="phone s01"><cite>Eric:</cite> It might be good, we'd have to think about what order we present them.<br>
<span id=x131>… I wonder if this isn't too early to do.</span><br>
<span id=x132>… Feel free to come up with a list.</span></p>
<p id=x133 class="phone s04"><cite>Todd:</cite> Do we want to add to the document which OS people are using?</p>
<p id=x134 class="phone s01"><cite>Eric:</cite> We could do that.</p>
<p id=x136 class="phone s04"><cite>Todd:</cite> If we have people that use Linux for example, we'd want to include them as well</p>
<p id=x138 class=irc><cite>&lt;Todd&gt;</cite> +1 to Killian's point</p>
<p id=x139 class="phone s07"><cite>Kilian:</cite> We should be cautious with suggestions, this will skew the data. People will say they'll want to have something they wouldn't actually use.</p>
<p id=x141 class=irc><cite>&lt;hdv&gt;</cite> Wilco: do we really need to know browser and operating systems? these statistics are already available elsewhere</p>
<p id=x142 class="phone s02"><cite>Wilco:</cite> Do we need to know browser / OS? What are we hoping to learn from that?</p>
<p id=x144 class="phone s01"><cite>Eric:</cite> If they choose a browser / OS because of the accessibility features, we may want to know that.</p>
<p id=x146 class="phone s07"><cite>Kilian:</cite> It will allow us to say something about discoverability of features, and their relative use between browsers.</p>

<h3 id=t04>A11y features website, update <a href="https://a11yfeat.com/">https://<wbr>a11yfeat.com/</a></h3>
<p id=x151 class="phone s01"><cite>Eric:</cite> I just wanted to highlight the website that Hidde built.<br>
<span id=x152>… We put up the minutes on it, we'll put the meeting time on it, so people can find us and participate.</span></p>
<p id=x153 class=irc><cite>&lt;hdv&gt;</cite> (repo if you want to contribute <a href="https://github.com/a11yfeat/a11yfeat.github.io/)">https://<wbr>github.com/<wbr>a11yfeat/<wbr>a11yfeat.github.io/)</a></p>
<p id=x154 class="phone s02"><cite>Wilco:</cite> Should we include the browser / OS features on there?</p>
<p id=x155 class="phone s01"><cite>Eric:</cite> Yeah, we should.</p>

<section>
<h3 id=t05>Color contrast plugin demo <a href="https://fixa11y.com/">https://<wbr>fixa11y.com/</a></h3>
<p id=x158 class="phone s07"><cite>Kilian:</cite> ... demos fix contrast plugin.</p>
<p id=x165 class=irc><cite>&lt;yatil&gt;</cite> Wilco: What about the performance/challenges in implementation?</p>
<p id=x166 class="phone s07"><cite>Kilian:</cite> Browsers could do this on their render pass. It would be much more performant than on an extension.</p>
<p id=x167 class="phone s02"><cite>Wilco:</cite> If we have good technologies like this, do we want to drive this in a direction where developers don't have to worry about this?</p>
<p id=x169 class="phone s01"><cite>Eric:</cite> I think it would be good to talk about that. While I want these features, especially for people who's need exceeds WCAG.<br>
<span id=x170>… We should consider that as an agenda item for next meeting.</span></p>

<section>
<h3 id=t06>Any Closing Comments?</h3>
<p id=x184 class=irc><cite>&lt;yatil&gt;</cite> &lt;no closing comments&gt;</p>
<p id=x187 class=irc><cite>&lt;yatil&gt;</cite> Next meeting in about 2 weeks, Eric will make a suggestion from the survey.</p>
