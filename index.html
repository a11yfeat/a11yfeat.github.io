        <h2 id="about-us">Introducing AFCG</h2>
        <p>
          The Accessibility Features Community Group (AFCG) promotes the
          development of features that can address accessibility issues in web
          content. Such features could be added to browsers, other user agents,
          and operating systems.
        </p>
        <h3>Examples</h3>
        <p>
          These accessibility features can come in a variety of forms, such as:
        </p>
        <ul class="features">
          <li>Always-on features <span>such as page and app resizing</span></li>
          <li>
            Toggles
            <span
              >such as always-visible focus indicators and high contrast
              modes</span
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            Settings <span>like preferred fonts and smallest text size</span>
          </li>
          <li>
            Fallback features
            <span>like automated captions and heading detection</span>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Deliverables</h3>
        <p>
          To promote the development of new accessibility features, AFCG plans
          to:
        </p>
        <ul class="todos">
          <li>
            Develop a list of features (part features already available, part
            new ideas)
          </li>
          <li>Track which features are supported where</li>
          <li>Prototype potential features when appropriate</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Benefits</h3>
        <dl>
          <dt>Better experience</dt>
          <dd>
            With a wide range of well-documented accessibility features, people
            with disabilities can get a better experience, even on sites that
            don't meet accessibility guidelines.
          </dd>
          <dt>Focus</dt>
          <dd>
            With reliable built-in features, content creators can focus their
            accessibility efforts on addressing challenges unique to their
            content.
          </dd>
          <dt>Harmonization</dt>
          <dd>
            Features could get more similar across browsers and operating
            systems, and work consistently for all provided content.
          </dd>

              Isn't fixing accessibility problems the responsibility of
              developers?
            </h3>
          </summary>
          <p>
            Primarily, yes. But ensuring accessibility is a responsibility that
            can be approached from different angles: content authors, user
            agents and authoring tools. These complement each other.
